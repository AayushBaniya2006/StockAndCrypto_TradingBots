Hello, 
this was the first bot that I tried to create with my own algorithm, however it is not working, nor do I think that if it was working, that it would be effective. 

The bot was supposed to take the market senitment (if people are feeling greedy or fearful), however I could not find any live csv's or databases that did this, so I tried to replicate it with the SMA. It then shorts the stock of choice if the market sentiment is greedy, and buys if the market is fearful.

This bot was simple, and hopefully can be finished in the near future.
