Hello!

I did not expect to finish my second bot this fast, nor for it to be this effective.

As my second project I wanted the bot to be effective while also teaching me different things. In comparison to my first bot (BitcoinBot1), this algorith is much for effective. Due to the fact that BitcoinBot1 was machine learning, there were a vast amount for error, and that really showed in the backend testing. In comparison this bot is 50x simpler, and probably 50x more effective.

So, this bot works by investing in #SPY or the stock designe to track the S&P 500 stock market index. So with that, sudden crashes aren't expected to happen and returns of 7% are expected each year, which is one of reasons why this algorithm is so effective. The bot invests 100% of its capital into SPY, and when it sees a 10% rise or drop, it instantly sells and waits 15 days to repeat the cycle. 

This method is great in a bear market as losses are minimal and are capped. However that also ends up being the bots greatest weakness, mainly in a bull market, where the winnings are also capped at 10%. The main drawback is also that the 15 day cycle really doesn't do anything, besides waiting to get out of a bear market so no profits or losses can be made during that time. 

I do see someways that this can be improved however, and my dad gave me some great advice, so be sure to look out for SpyEffectiveBot2 in which I apply these findings and increase expected revenue even more.
