Hello! 

This bot is a bot which I honestly GREATLY do not recommend anyone using, unless they like to lose money. The main goal for this bot was just to get a glimpse of how rolling windows work + consolodating, so with that this bot truely does suck. 

How the bot works is that it takes SPY, and it adds the day value in the rolling window. Afterwards the next day, it checks if there is an increase by .01%, in which case is shorts the stock, or a decrease by .01 percent, in which it buys the stock. Overall if there is a bear or bull market this bot doesn't really work; it only really works if the market is neutral or if the stock has virtually no volatility like SPY.

There are some way to fix the bot, its probably recommended to just try another one.
