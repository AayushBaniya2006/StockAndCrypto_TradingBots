Hello, quick update on the progress-

For the past 2 months, I have been focusing on forms of techincal analysis and overall what technical analysis is. 
This is so I can further understand which bots are effective using past data and analysis. 
I feel as though I am slowly getting the hang of it and am understanding it more effectively.
The ultimate goal is to no longer rely on different types of tutorials and fully develop bots on my own.
