# StockAndCrypto_TradingBots

Trading Platform Used: QuantConnect 

All code was moved from QuantConnect to this github file, running the code in an IDE such as VS Code will NOT work, thank you. 

Welcome to my GitHub repository that holds a collection of trading bots for both cryptocurrency and stock market trading. As trading in digital currencies has become more popular, automated trading systems have become increasingly in demand. My repository highlights my learning in these fields

Each trading bot in my repository uses a different trading strategy (ranging from advanced to basic), which is described in detail in each projects own folder. This includes an overview of the bot's functionality, trading algorithm, and performance metrics. You'll alsp find information about the specific indicators and signals used in the bots, the types of orders they execute, and the risk management strategies employed, effectivness of the bot, profit/loss made, how the bot could be made more efficent, screenshots displaying the outcome of the bot, and more. 

The bots in this repository aim to make trading more efficient, profitable, and enjoyable by providing valuable insights and data-driven recommendations that can help you to optimize your trades, reduce risk, and improve your overall trading performance.

Whether you're an experienced trader or just starting out, my repository offers a range of advanced trading strategies that can be customized to meet your specific needs and goals.
