Hello! 

This was my first crypto project, it takes a 40 day analysis of the market and how it expects bitcoin to flucuate day by day.

As this was my furst project, the main goal was just to learn about some trading stratagies and the actual code/function on how these work.

Because of this I HIGHLY RECOMMMEND this not be used as it really is quite ineffective, but I am not dissapointed for this being my starter point!

The main reason this lacks is because of the fees, it just takes too much (because the trades are happening daily).
