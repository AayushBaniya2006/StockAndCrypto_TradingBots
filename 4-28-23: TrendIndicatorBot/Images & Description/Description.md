Hello!

This once again is a very simple but quite an effective bot, firstly it takes the SMA, or simple moving average, and predicts whether the stock is in an uptrend (Price above SMA) or downtrend (Price below SMA). It then takes the 52 week high and low, and buts if the stock is in an uptrend near high, and sells if it is at a downtrend near low. 

This trading bot, like the previous cases, is only for trual, and is gighly not reccommended for trial use. However learning how to code this bot gave me oppurtunies to learn many thing.

For one, next time I could use a rolling door so instead of pulling the yearly data everyday it would do it infrequently. 

This bot does do better on some stocks than other, it also has great highs and lows. If we view the "Calm Red Goshawk" the bot makes, at one point, 2200% return but then levels back down to 700% (which is still crazy, but lower than market). When using SPY instead, in the "Calculating Yellow Green Cormorant", the bot preforms onpar with the market, not having any crazy ups or downs.

The best way to improve the bot, is to add a stop loss prevention so it doesn't have crazy down spikes like in the TSLA example. 

This bot will also include a benchmark, which previous bots don't, because it involves 52 week highs and lows, and SMAs.
