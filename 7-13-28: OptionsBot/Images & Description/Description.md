Hello!

The main goal of this trading bot is to learn more about options, and I learned a lot from this bot!


This bot is very simple. If the chosen stock (Microsoft for example however that can be changed) moves above its 1 month high, then an ATM call option is bought with 5% of available portfolio to reduce risk.

Overall the bot is pretty decent but if you have poor risk tolerance this bot is not for you as there are times where the bot explodes and other times where the bot loses thousands.
