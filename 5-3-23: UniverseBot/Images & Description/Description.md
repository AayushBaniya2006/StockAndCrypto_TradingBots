Hello!


This bot creates a new "Universe" and updates it every single month. The bot selects the top 200 stocks with the highest dollar volume where the price is >10 so it's not just a shit stock. After that it takes top 10 stocks in the FineFilter. Afterwards investing in them with the entire portfolio by an equal amount. The bot then updates every single month and liquidates the stocks removed from top 200.

Overall this bot completely sucks and is highly reccommened to not be used.
